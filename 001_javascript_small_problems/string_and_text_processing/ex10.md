# Problem

- The function from the previous exercise returns the number of occurrences of a word in some text. 
- Although this is useful, there are also situations in which we just want to find the word in the context of the text.

- For this exercise:
- write a function that takes a word and some text as arguments
- returns the text with every instance of the word highlighted.
- To highlight a word, enclose the word with 
  - two asterisks ('**') on each side and ** 
  - change every letter of the word to uppercase (e.g., '**HIGHLIGHTEDWORD**')

1. Input: a word and a sentence, both strings
2. Output: the same sentence but with every occurrence:
  - surrounded by asterisks, two on each side
  - uppercased 


# Example

searchWord('sed', text);
// returns
// "**SED** ut p ....... ""

# Data Structure

Array

# Algorithm

1. Split the sentence into words 
2. Map each sentenceWord: 
  - if sentenceWord includes word:
    - return the modified word
