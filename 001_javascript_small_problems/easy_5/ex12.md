# Problem

- As seen in the previous exercise
- time of day can be represented by number of minutes
- before or after midnight
- If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight
- If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight

- Write two functions that each take a time of day in 24 hour format
- and return the number of minutes before and after midnight
- Both functions should return a value in the range 0..1439.

1. Input: Time in 24 hour format:
  - 00:00 / 12:21 / ...
2. Output: Integer of time in minutes 
3. Question:
  - Do I have to return a negative number? no.
  - rage from 0...1439 

# Examples

console.log(afterMidnight("00:00") === 0);
console.log(beforeMidnight("00:00") === 0);

console.log(afterMidnight("12:34") === 754);
console.log(beforeMidnight("12:34") === 686);

console.log(afterMidnight("24:00") === 0);
console.log(beforeMidnight("24:00") === 0);

# Data Structure

Number

# Algorithm

1. After midnight:
  - Split string into two numbers 
  - multiply first by 60
  - add result + second 
  - return
2. Before midnight:
  - split string into two numbers 
  - subtract first from 23 / then multiply by 60
  - subtract second from 60
  - add two together
