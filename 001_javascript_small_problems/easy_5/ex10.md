# Problem

- Write a function that takes one argument, an array of integers
- returns the average of all the integers in the array
- rounded down to the integer component of the average. 
- The array will never be empty
- the numbers will always be positive integers.

# Example

average([1, 5, 87, 45, 8, 8]);       // 25
average([9, 47, 23, 95, 16, 52]);    // 40

# Data Structure

Array

# Algorithm

- Reduce the array to the sum of its elements
- divide that result by length of array and parseInt
