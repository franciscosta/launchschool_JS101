# Problem

- Time of day = the number of minutes before or after midnight
- If the number of minutes is positive, the time is after midnight
- If the number of minutes is negative, the time is before midnight

- Write a function that takes a time using this minute-based format
- returns the time of day in 24 hour format (hh:mm)
- Your function should work with any integer input
- You may not use javascript's Date class methods.

1. Input: An integer representing number of minutes 
2. Output: A string representing a time of day 
3. Rules:
  - Negative number is before mid night 
  - Positive number is after midnight 

# Examples

console.log(timeOfDay(0) === "00:00");
console.log(timeOfDay(-3) === "23:57");
console.log(timeOfDay(35) === "00:35");
console.log(timeOfDay(-1437) === "00:03");
console.log(timeOfDay(3000) === "02:00");
console.log(timeOfDay(800) === "13:20");
console.log(timeOfDay(-4231) === "01:29");

# Data Structure

Number
Object

# Algorithm

1. Set object: hours, minutes
2. Divide input by number of hours in a minute 
3. Subtract the number of hours * number of hours in a min from input:
4. Now I have hours and leftover minutes
5. Now I need to get the number of days and subtract it from hours
6. So that in the end, I'm working with the actual leftover hours and minutes
7. Now I need to determine if the input is positive or negative 
  - if positive hours = hours / minutes = minutes
  - if negative hours = 24 - hours / minutes = 60 - minutes
