# Problem

- Write a function that takes a string argument containing one or more words
- returns a new string containing the words from the string argument. 
- All five-or-more letter words should have their letters in reverse order.
- The string argument will consist of only letters and spaces. 
- Words will be separated by a single space.

1. Input: a string with one or more words 
2. Output: a string with the words in the same order but if the words themselves are longer than 5 characters, the words themselves should be reversed

# Example

reverseWords('Professional');             // "lanoisseforP"
reverseWords('Walk around the block');    // "Walk dnuora the kcolb"
reverseWords('Launch School');            // "hcnuaL loohcS"

# Data Structure

Array + String

# Algorithm

1. Split the string into words 
2. Map that Array
  - if word.length >= 5: 
    - .split() the word 
    - .reverse() the word 
    - .join() the word 
    - Maybe this can be isolated into a method
