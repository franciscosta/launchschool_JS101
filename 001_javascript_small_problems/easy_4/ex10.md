# Problem

  1. Given a string of words separated by spaces
  2. Write a function that swaps the first and last letters of every word.
  3. You may assume that every word contains at least one letter
  4. string will always contain at least one word
  5. assume that each string contains nothing but words and spaces
  6. there are no leading, trailing, or repeated spaces.

  1. Input: A string of space-separated words 
  2. Output: A string with words in same order but:
    a. in each word, first and last char are reversed
    b. such that Hello -> oellH 
  3. Rules/Edge-Cases:
    a. String only contains words 
    b. At least one word, with at least one char 
    c. No punctuation 

# Examples

swap('Oh what a wonderful day it is');  // "hO thaw a londerfuw yad ti si"
swap('Abcde');                          // "ebcdA"
swap('a');                              // "a"

# Data Structures

  1. Array to manage words 
  2. String 

# Algorithm

  1. Abstraction: inverter()
    a. A method that takes a word and flips first and last char
    
    a. Get word 
    b. If word.length <= 1: return word 
    c. Set len = word.length 
    c. Return word[len - 1] + word.slice(1, len - 1) + word[0]

  2. Main Function:
    a. Get string 
    b. Set words = string into words (' ')
    c. Loop through indeces of array of words:
      a. words[index] = inverter(words[index])
    d. string = words.join(' ')
    e. Return string
